# 3DPrinterTestingCode

It has been a while since I uploaded to this repo since everything with the printer has gone well! I have had a lot of hardware issues but the software side of things has been a breeze. 
The prints come out looking a bit rough but that is mostly due to bad cooling of the parts during printing.

I have included the configuration.h file for the Marlin software incase I ever need to remember it. This is not code I wrote myself but it is customized for my printer so I'll include it.

There really isn't much more to say on this for the software side of things. I have written some gcode for this but I don't think I would write a slicer since that does not relate to graphics much, though I won't say never.

Below is a link to a picture of the 3d printer. As you can see, it does print and can do so reliably.
